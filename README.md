# Arduino Parking Assistant

## Project Overview
An intelligent parking assistance system with real-time obstacle monitoring and auditory feedback. Provides also data logging capabilities.

## Features
- **Multi-Sensor Monitoring** - ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive obstacle detection
- **Physical Collision Detection** - limit switches for registering physical contact
- **Intuitive Auditory Feedback** - buzzer with distance-proportional beeping
- **Real-time Data Logging** - complete parking process recording with distance graphs from each ultrasonic sensor and fact of collision registered from limit switches

## 🛠 Hardware
- Arduino Board
- 3× Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- Passive Buzzer
- 2x Limit Switches (PAS00929)
